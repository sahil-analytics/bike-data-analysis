# 🚴‍♂️Bike Shop Analysis Project🚴‍♂️

**Hi, I’m Sahil 👋 I’m a data enthusiast specializing in SQL, Power BI, and Analytics. This repository showcases my Bike Shop Analysis project, where I analyzed sales and profitability trends over two years to generate actionable insights. The project compared a bike shop's level of sales and profitability for two years using SQL and Power BI. The objective was to determine trends, establish insights, and suggest price and profitability increments.**

## 📊Project Overview

Data from the following sources were analyzed:
	•	bike_share_yr_0 – Year 0 bike sharing data
	•	bike_share_yr_1 – Year 1 bike sharing data
	•	cost_table – Costs and prices for each bike

**Process: Data cleaning and merging were performed using SQL, and visualizations were created in Power BI to build an interactive dashboard highlighting key metrics.**

## 🛠Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: For data cleaning, data transformation, and data analysis.
- **Power BI**: For creating data visualizations and dashboards.

## 🚀Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation in SQL:**
   - Joined data from `bike_share_yr_0` and `bike_share_yr_1` using a `UNION ALL` query.
   - Joined the joined data with `cost_table` to calculate revenue and profit.
   - Calculated the following measures:
     - **Revenue**: `riders * price`
- **Profit**: `revenue - COGS`

   Example SQL Query:
   ```sql
   WITH cte AS (
       SELECT * FROM bike_share_yr_0
       UNION ALL
       SELECT * FROM bike_share_yr_1
   )
   SELECT 
       dteday, season, a.yr, weekday, hr, rider_type, riders, price, COGS,
       riders * price AS revenue,
       (riders * price) - COGS AS profit
   FROM cte AS a
   LEFT JOIN cost_table AS b 
   ON a.yr = b.yr;
   ```

2. **Exporting Results:**
- SQL query written to a CSV file to be imported into Power BI.

3. **Power BI Visualization:**
   - Designed an interactive dashboard with the following capabilities:
     - **KPI Metrics:** Total riders, revenue, and profit.
     - **Revenue and Profit Over Time:** Bar and line chart illustrating trends over a two-year period.
- **Revenue by Season:** Bar chart of revenue by season.
     - **Riders Demographics:** Donut chart of the ratio between casual and registered users.
     - **Profitability by Hour:** Heatmap of revenue by hour and day of the week.

## 📈Key Findings

1. **When Are We Making Money?**
- Increased revenue is earned between midday and early evening (10:00 AM to 3:00 PM).
- Wednesday and Friday have much higher sales.

2. **Seasonal Revenue:**
   - The highest revenue was generated by Season 2, followed by Season 1.

3. **Rider Statistics:**
   - Registered riders account for 81.17% of overall revenue.
   - Casual riders account for 18.83% of overall revenue.

4. **KPI Summary:**
   - Total Riders: 3 Million
   - Total Revenue: $15 Million
   - Total Profit: $15.14 Million

## 💡Recommendations

1. **Conservative Price Increase:**
   - A 10-15% price increase is recommended to test the market without alienating too many customers.
   - For example:
     - A 10% increase would price the item at $5.49 from $4.99.
- The cost would be around $5.74 with a 15% rise.

2. **Segmented Pricing Strategy:**
   - Implement various pricing policies for registered riders and occasional riders according to their price elasticity.

3. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Keep an eye on customer reactions and sales history cautiously upon implementing change in price to make required adjustments in turn.

4. **Focus on Peak Hours:**
- Maximize resource and personnel availability between peak revenue hours (10:00 AM to 3:00 PM).

## 🗂 Repository Files

1. **SQL Queries:**
   - All SQL scripts utilized to prep data and analysis.

2. **CSV Files:**
   - Export of query results for use in Power BI.

3. **Power BI Dashboard:**
   - .pbix file for the interactive dashboard.
